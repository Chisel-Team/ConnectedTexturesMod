0.2.2:
Changes

Fixes

0.2.1:
New
- Two new render types, edges and edges_full, which can be used to change appearances when adjacent to other certain blocks.
- CTM (and all CTM subtypes, including edges and edges_full) now support "connect_to" in their extra{} data. See the wiki for documentation on this new feature.
Changes
- All texture type names have been changed. Old names will still work, for now. Notable changes: R->random, V->pattern, CTMH->ctm_horizontal, CTMV->pillar. All others were just lowercased.
Fixes
- Fix crash when shift+F3 was used while a CTM-rendered item was visible.
 
0.2.0:
New
- CTM (and CTM subtypes, CTMH etc.) now support "ignoreStates" and "connectInside" for their extra{} data.
- All texture metadata can now specify a "proxy" which is to be used if CTM is present.
Changes
- CTMH has been reworked, now only requires one texture
- If no ctm_version is found inside a metadata section, the texture will fail to load
- Improved error handling, and a model will fail to load if the wrong number of textures are provided for a type.
Fixes
- Fix cache collision when multiple types serialize to the same value
- Fix overrides with metadata using wrong sprite
- Fix overriden sprites having incorrect UVs
- Fix non-full cubes having their CTM obscured on unculled sides
- Fix Chisel-Team/Chisel#474 crash when CTM is applied to pure item model
- Fix handlePerspective breaking item models
